<summary><b> Abstract. </b></summary>
Student debt decreases post-bachelor school enrollment and earnings growth but does not delay first-time home ownership. We introduce a life-cycle human capital model with heterogeneous wealth and financial frictions and show that high debt balances distort career choices because returns to further education depend on current income. Student debt impacts home ownership in two ways. First, it deters ownership via the traditional wealth channel. Second, it increases ownership by discouraging further education in favor of early labor market entry. Finally, we show that the impact of student borrowing is partly due to the design of US student loans.

<summary><b> Abstract. </b></summary>
 I propose a global solution method for the computation of infinite-horizon, heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models with aggregate uncertainty. Details of the algorithm are illustrated by presenting its application to a an example model of firm dynamics. In the model, aggregate dynamics depends explicitly on firm entry and exit, and individual choices are often constrained by a form of market incompleteness. Existing computational strategies are either unfeasible or provide inaccurate solutions to this class of models. Moreover, global solutions are computationally expensive because the minimal representation of the aggregate state space - and thus the aggregate law of motion - faces the curse of dimensionality. The proposed strategy combines adaptive sparse grids with a cross-sectional density approximation, and introduces a framework for solving the more general class of dynamic models with firm or household heterogeneity accurately.

<summary><b> Abstract. </b></summary>
We analyze the impact of recessions on productivity in the labor market by building a model where workers increase human capital by matching with firms of higher quality along the job ladder. We estimate the model on administrative matched employer-employee data and quantify the importance of sorting and learning for aggregate fluctuations. We show that, following a negative productivity shock, scarring effects on workers reflect not only a worsening of their outside options in bad times, but also a reduction in the overall productive capacity of the economy. Recessions thus have a sullying effect, generating hysteresis without aggregate demand externalities. A decomposition of the cumulative output loss after a negative shock reveals that the worsening in worker-firm sorting and distortions in human capital accumulation explain more than 60\% of the loss in aggregate output. The model is then used to offer a new explanation for the increased length of recessions and their heterogeneous welfare effects across the age, income and human capital distributions.

<summary><b> Abstract. </b></summary>
To what extent are young workers affected by health shocks that happen to their parents? This paper studies the short and long-term spillover effects of parents' adverse health events on their adult children. We use the unique structure of the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics (PSID) to build family networks and construct a measure of sudden health changes. Exploiting news on parents' health status, we provide evidence of the existence of family insurance in the form of time and monetary transfers, and of the importance of family ties in shaping labor market outcomes. Following the deterioration of parents' health, time spent helping them goes up, while income and hours worked by children significantly decline.
